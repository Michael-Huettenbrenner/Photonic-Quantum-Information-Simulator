    Parameters
    ----------
    Fock_Basis : TYPE
        List of (all) fock basis states.
    photon_present : TYPE
        Specifies in which mode there must be atleast one photon. A detector (non number resolving) would click if inserted at this point.
    no_photon_present : TYPE
        Specifies in which mode there must not be a photon. A detector must not click if inserted at this point.

    Returns
    -------
    TYPE
        The Basis states that fullfil the click-mask's conditions.

    Parameters
    ----------
    Fock_states: np.ndarray of all Fock states we want test for the condition, maybe the entire basis
    Modes_with_restriction : np.ndarray
        Array of all mode indices, where a certain photon number needs to/ must not be present
    Required_photon_numbers : np.ndarray
        Photon numbers for said modes
    exclude : Int, optional
        If it is 0, states that agree in all specifications are returned.
        If it is 1, states that share any similarity with the specificaion are returned
        If it is 2, all states that match exactly the specifications are excluded. 
        If 3, states that share any similarity with the specified requirements (i.e. a single photon number for a given mode) are excluded. 
        The default is 0.

    Returns
    -------
    valid_rows: np.ndarray
        Array of all valid states.
