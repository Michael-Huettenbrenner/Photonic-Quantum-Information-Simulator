# Photonic-Quantum-Information-Simulator
This simulator implements Ryser's algorithm with Gray code ordering to calculate transition amplitudes between photonic quantum states, that go through a circuit. It provides the means to build arbitrary linear optics quantum circuits, send in arbitrary mixed states, specify a heralding pattern, and even work with partial distinguishability.


You can download the folder called simulator, and use it by placing the .py file that contains your simulation in the same parent folder as the simulator folder. 

There exists a file to demonstrate the usage of this package, and I highly recommend you check it out first.


Have fun, I am extremely happy knowing someone might actually derive some value from this work. -M
