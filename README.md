# Photonic-Quantum-Information-Simulator
This simulator implements Ryser's algorithm with Gray code ordering to calculate transition amplitudes between photonic quantum states, that go through a circuit. It provides the means to build arbitrary linear optics quantum circuits, send in arbitrary mixed states, specify a heralding pattern, and even work with partial distinguishability
